          FRONTIER DEVICES LINUX SUPPORT

This repo is intended to make Frontier's devices more accesible on linux
I cloned the code from git://toutatis.isc.org/home/d/src/git/frontier.git
This is my personal repo, and I will try get changes upstream when they're done.

Huge thanks to David Taht for the fantasic work he's done.
