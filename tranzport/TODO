Fix udev permissions to tranzport driver
Fix patches for kernel driver
* eliminate sysfs stuff DONE
* Submit signed-off-by DONE
* clean up driver
* implement multibyte reads/writes
* Write throttling

Fix Ardour driver
Linux only (requires hardware driver)
Extremely low cpu usage
Reliable keystrokes and many shuttle movements
Slave to screen settings
Realtime no longer required
display made reliable through offline & battery events
 
* scrub no longer increments past .1
* Shuttle is precisely backwards (but increments) * FIXED
* Direction doesn't work right - only takes positive/negative/0 - would prefer to take an offset - fixed by recursive call to set_snap_to 
* estimator for going backwards while tranzport is running
* Undo issue - can crash ardour with marker create/undo. More obvious in 3.0
* Marker moves of cd markers is broken in gui
* Movement by region starts/ends does not work
* display should be slaved to second clock
* Movement with grid on is busted - fixed
* Display still has minor glitches - doesn't display current position until move
* epoll switch w/callbacks
* config screen
* implement alphatrack
* realtime scheduling is no longer required (I think) R/T disabled for now.
* Most Movement works but can underflow. Movement by beats can fail, less always fails.
* No grid + CD frames - moves by samples works
* switch to git
* backlight redraws screen, battery does not
